### Differences between Interface and types in Typescript

1. The main difference is, we can use types for defining type for both primitive and non-primitive datas.On the other hand,we can only use Interface to define type for non-primitive data types.
2. If we want to extend any type from a parent type,for types we have to use (&) sign for this.But for interface we have to use extends keyword.
3. If we want to define a number type,we can easily do this through types.But we cannot define a number type through interface.
